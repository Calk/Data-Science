1 - All the datasets in the center row, the first and last datasets of the
first row and maybe the datasets that have 0.8 and -0.8 correlation coefficients.
All these datasets could be projected into one PCA component vector without losing much information.
Almost all the variation of the variables would be captured by the projection into just one component.

2 - Since the smaples already has two dimensions,
applying PCA would not reduce the dimentionality of our datasets and could cause lost of information.
