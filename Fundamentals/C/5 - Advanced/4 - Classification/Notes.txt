The problem of dimensionality is specially important in the kNN algorithmn.
This happenns because high dimension dataset tend to have a very sparse distribution of observations.
Since the knn algo regards on 'euclidian distance', it cannot perform well in those scenarios.
A possible solution for this problem could be to use PCA in order to reduce de dimension of the dataset.

People dont use decision trees today, they prefer to use random forest 
since it generates a lot of decision trees and get the average decision.

3 greatest classifiers:
Random forest
SVM - Support Vector Machines
Deep Learning (more recent)
